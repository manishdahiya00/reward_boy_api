    <h3>QuizBox Terms & Conditions</h3>

    <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Agreement") govern the relationship between QuizBox Inc. ("We" or "QuizBox")
      and the end user ("User" or "Customer"). QuizBox is a mobile app available for Android and iOS. The app and
      website are managed and operated by QuizBox Inc. We generate reports from QuizBox operations to provide
      insights for our clients' operations and product development.</p>

    <p class="section-title">Agreement</p>
    <p>This Agreement establishes a self-governing contractor relationship between QuizBox and users. Users are
      considered contractors, while QuizBox is the contractee. Tasks and offers are provided on a rotational basis,
      and users may choose to accept or reject these offers. QuizBox may share user details with clients whose offers
      users choose to complete to earn rewards.</p>

    <p class="section-title">Rewards</p>
    <p>Rewards earned from completing tasks or offers are based on the quantity and quality of reports received by
      QuizBox from advertisers. We are not liable for rewards or cash not credited to user accounts due to system
      bugs, internet connectivity issues, or other factors. Credited rewards will expire after 30 days of inactivity.
      QuizBox is not responsible for failed or unsuccessful redemptions and will not provide repayment.</p>

    <p class="section-title">Restriction of Rights</p>
    <p>Users do not have the right to impasse, force, or obligate QuizBox in any manner, whether written or oral.</p>

    <p class="section-title">Disputes</p>
    <p>In case of any disputes or failures to perform under this Agreement, users must work with QuizBox to resolve
      the issues. Users cannot hold QuizBox responsible for any claims, demands, suits, or liabilities, including
      costs or other fees.</p>

    <p class="section-title">Registration, Password & Security</p>
    <p>By providing data on our Website/App, you agree to provide accurate, sincere, current, and complete information,
      and to update such information as needed. If we determine that the information is false, incorrect, outdated, or
      incomplete, QuizBox may terminate your access to the website or app and refuse all current or future use of our
      services.</p>

    <p class="section-title">Termination</p>
    <p>Either QuizBox or the end user may terminate the Agreement at any time, with or without cause. Upon
      termination, users will not be eligible for any awards or rewards. QuizBox may also terminate user accounts
      without prior notice if users are found promoting referral links in a misleading or spamming manner on public
      platforms.</p>

    <p class="section-title">Breach of Agreement</p>
    <p>Users understand and agree that any breach or speculative breach may cause damages to QuizBox that are
      difficult to quantify. Therefore, QuizBox has the right to restrict users from using our services and may seek
      judicial action for damages, including court costs or other fees.</p>
